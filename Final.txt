1. Introduction 
Body static is relatively motionless and accumulative charge in human body caused by walk, operation, touching and  separating with other objects, or other reasons, like electrostatic induction and space charge adsorption, which would make  the positive and negative polarity of the body out of balance. And accordingly, it may macroscopically present some kind of  polar charge accumulation so that the human body of the ground potential with static energy is not zero. Because of high  resistance wear, floor and other factors, body static is hard to be divulged in time, and sometimes it could be up to thousands  or even tens of thousands of volts. Body static may not only cause a loss to the human body itself, but also may cause fire  disaster. When there is combustible mixture in the surrounding and its concentration is within the range of the explosion  limitation, and the energy of the electrostatic discharge is greater than or equal to the minimum ignition energy of the  mixture, it is possible to induce explosion and fire accident. To reduce the risk of body static people create a great amount of  human body static elimination technologies, for instance, wearing anti-static shoes and suit, using grounding wrist strap to  connect human body with ground, improving the ambient humidity and using human body static elimination device, which  of these are currently represent active technologies. However, it is unknown of the effectiveness of different human body  static elimination technology in the actual use. Thus, this passage is aimed at the experimental study of the influence  between human body electrostatic potential and human body static elimination technology with specific process.

1. Introduction 
Body static is relatively motionless and accumulative charge in human body caused by walk, operation, touching and  separating with other objects, or other reasons, like electrostatic induction and space charge adsorption, which would make  the positive and negative polarity of the body out of balance. And accordingly, it may macroscopically present some kind of  polar charge accumulation so that the human body of the ground potential with static energy is not zero. Because of high  resistance wear, floor and other factors, body static is hard to be divulged in time, and sometimes it could be up to thousands  or even tens of thousands of volts. Body static may not only cause a loss to the human body itself, but also may cause fire  disaster. When there is combustible mixture in the surrounding and its concentration is within the range of the explosion  limitation, and the energy of the electrostatic discharge is greater than or equal to the minimum ignition energy of the  mixture, it is possible to induce explosion and fire accident. To reduce the risk of body static people create a great amount of  human body static elimination technologies, for instance, wearing anti-static shoes and suit, using grounding wrist strap to  connect human body with ground, improving the ambient humidity and using human body static elimination device, which  of these are currently represent active technologies. However, it is unknown of the effectiveness of different human body  static elimination technology in the actual use. Thus, this passage is aimed at the experimental study of the influence  between human body electrostatic potential and human body static elimination technology with specific process. 



2. Experiment design 
2.1. The construction of human body static test environment 
Researchers use EST405 static dynamic computer detection and alarm system, which utilizes non-contact static  measurement with three adjusted gears:0~ ± 2kV, 0~ ± 20kV and 0~ ± 100kV, to measure human body electrostatic  potential. At the same time, to avoid the influence of environment humidity, the environment humidity and temperature are  controlled by researchers during the experiment, with 34 ± 3% and 22 ± 2 ℃ respectively. When measuring, researchers  connect system probe with a ground-insulated hollow mental ball which is connected with mental handle by wire. In the  experiment which is always carried out on the concrete floor, tested person grips the metal handle to measure the  electrostatic potential. The test bench is arranged as Fig.1 shown below. 


In order to verify the effectiveness of different human body static elimination technology, the anti-static shoes, anti-static  suit, anti-static wrist strap, and grounding wrist strap are selected as research objects. Due to the obvious influence of human  body electrostatic potential caused by any human movement, a certain result of the actual use process of static elimination  technologies, researchers set three usual human motions as variables, with walk, run and jump. These three human  movements with increased intensity in turn are the most common behaviors in daily life, which could be used to study the  effect of human motion on the effectiveness of static elimination technology. 
2.2. The experiment scheme 
This experiment adopts three types of human body movements as Table 1 shows. 





The subjects are wearing a winter camouflage suit during the experiment on the exterior and a specified sweater as well  as thermal underwear on the interior, their feet are wearing a pair of training shoes. During the experiment, the ground  condition is cement floor, the humidity is 34%, and the temperature is 22  ℃ . The anti-static shoes used in this experiment  are anti-static footwear produced by Beijing Anke star protective equipment limited liability company, its tread is produced  by one step molding with PVC granules, its upper material is made of canvas, and the surface resistance of its tread is 10 Ω. 


The anti-static suits used in this experiment are jumpsuit produced by Beijing Anke star protective equipment co. LTD, the  anti-static labor suits are interwoven with polyester and conductive fiber stripes that are 5mm wide, the surface resistance of  the suits are from 10 Ω to 10 Ω. The grounding wrist strap used in this experiment are AS -611 wired anti-static wrist strap  produced by Wenzhou YILAITE Electrical co. LTD, which consists of stationary wrist strap, electrostatic belt and alligator  clip. The internal surface of the wrist strap is conductive sand, the electrical impedance of the wrist strap is less than 50 Ω,  the electrical impedance of the wire is 10 Ω, the electrostatic belt is around 3m in length. Keep the alligator clip grounded  during usage, the range of human activity shall not exceed the length of the wrist strap. The anti-static wrist strap used in  this experiment are anti-static wrist strap produced by Kanazawa, which supposedly uses metallic titanium piece to release  human body static electricity. Three experiments are carried out after the variable changes in order to keep the accuracy of  the experiment data and prevent the data from large error. The experimental grouping of different electrostatic elimination  technologies of human body static electricity are shown as Table 2. 











3. Results and analyses 
The human body electrostatic potential of different electrostatic elimination technologies under the walking frequency of  84 steps/min is shown in Fig 2. 


















We can find from figure 1 that wearing anti-static shoes, anti-static suit, wearing anti-static shoes and suit together, and  wearing grounding wrist strap have reduced the human body electrostatic potential in different extent. Among them,  wearing the grounding wrist strap presents the best result in reducing human body electrostatic potential, which ensures the  potential at low level at all times. Wearing the anti-static shoes and suit together is in the second place, which also reduces  human body electrostatic potential significantly. Wearing the anti-static suit alone does reduce human body electrostatic  potential, but the effect is not significant. Wearing the anti-static wrist strap alone has no effect on reducing human body  electrostatic potential at all.  The human body electrostatic potential of different electrostatic elimination technologies under the running frequency of  120 steps/min is shown in Fig 3. 















We can find from the figure that these 5 electrostatic elimination technologies shows similar extent in human body  electrostatic potential reduction with the walking condition. The effect of wearing grounding wrist strap shows the best  result, wearing anti-static shoes and suit together is in the second place, wearing anti-static shoes alone is in the third place,  wearing anti-static suit is in the fourth place. While, wearing the anti-static wrist strap has no effect on reducing human  body electrostatic potential at all.  The human body electrostatic potential of different electrostatic elimination technologies under the jumping frequency of  60 times/min is shown in Fig 4. 

















We can find from the figure that under jumping condition, wearing anti-static shoes as well as wearing anti-static shoes  and suit together shows higher human body electrostatic potential compared to general dressing, wearing anti-static wrist  strap shows a human body electrostatic potential equals to the general condition. We can find that in the jumping condition,  wearing anti-static shoes, anti-static wrist strap, and wearing anti-static shoes and suit together do not have effect in  reducing human body electrostatic potential. Wearing the anti-static suit shows relatively good result in reducing human  body electrostatic potential, wearing grounding wrist strap obtains the best  effects of human body electrostatic  .  The maximum human body electrostatic potential under different experimental conditions are shown in Figure 5. 














We can see from the figure that, the human body movements show great effects on the human body electrostatic  potential. Anti-static shoes, wearing anti-static shoes and suit together, wearing grounding wrist strap, the human body  electrostatic potential is the lowest in the walking condition, following by the running condition, the jumping condition  shows the highest electrostatic potential. The human body electrostatic potential of wearing the anti-static suit reaches the  maximum in the running condition, following by the walking condition, the jumping condition shows the lowest  electrostatic potential. The decreasing of electrostatic potential during the jumping is probably because the electrification  speed is lower than the electrostatic elimination speed of the anti-static suit in the jumping condition. The overall patterns  show that the more acute human body movements are, the less effective the electrostatic elimination is. 
4. Conclusions 
By carrying out the experiments of different electrostatic elimination technologies on the effects of reducing human body  electrostatic potential, the experiment results show that, different electrostatic elimination technologies show different  electrostatic elimination effects, human body movements also directly influence the effect of human body electrostatic   elimination. Among all the experimented human body static elimination technologies, the anti-static wrist strap has no effect  in reducing human body electrostatic potential, the anti-static shoes and suit are able to reduce human body electrostatic  potential in a certain extent, while the grounding wrist strap effectively reduces the static fire risk.
